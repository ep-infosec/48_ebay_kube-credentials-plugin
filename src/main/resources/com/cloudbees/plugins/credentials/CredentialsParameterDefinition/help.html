<div>
    Defines a credentials parameter, which you can use during a build.
    <p style="font-weight: bold; padding: 5px; background: darkred; color: white; text-align: center">
    <i>For security reasons</i>, the credential is <i>NOT</i> directly exposed, the UUID of the credential is exposed.
    </p>
    However, the selected credential is available through variable substitution in some other parts of the configuration.
    The string value will be the UUID of the credential. A supporting plugin can thus use the UUID to retrieve
    the selected credential and expose it to the build in an appropriate way.
